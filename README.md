# Züri’s Newest Bricklaying Verein

But seriously, we play basketball.

The Züri Bricklayers are a casual, international
basketball group that plays for fun. We meet most Mondays and
Wednesdays from 8-10 pm (see the calendar for exact details).
We play at Kantonsschule Enge. Map [link](https://t.ly/dD0CT).
